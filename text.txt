Lalibela (ላሊበላ) is history and mystery frozen in 
stone, its soul alive with the rites and awe of 
Christianity at its most ancient and unbending. 
No matter what you’ve heard about Lalibela, no 
matter how many pictures you’ve seen of its 
breathtaking rock-hewn churches, nothing can 
prepare you for the reality of seeing it for 
yourself. It’s not only a World Heritage site, but
 truly a world wonder. Spending a night vigil here
during one of the big religious festivals, when 
white-robed pilgrims in their hundreds crowd the 
courtyards of the churches, is to witness 
Christianity in its most raw and powerful form.
